# check-certs

After the encrypted traffic interception on https://notes.valdikss.org.ru/jabber.ru-mitm/,
I decided to write a script to check if any certificates appear in the 
certificate transparency logs for the domains I'm hosting aka where I knew, when the certificates were issued.

## Usage

Python3 is needed to run the script.
The additional dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

```
$ ./check-certs.py domain1.com domain2.com
```

For ease of use, you should add this script to your crontab:

```
0 0 * * * /path/to/check-certs.py domain1.com domain2.com
```

You'll get a mail with all certificate details if any new certificates appear in the CT-logs.
